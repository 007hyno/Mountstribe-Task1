        <h1><strong><b>Mountstribe Agritech Pvt. Ltd. Policies</b></strong></h1>
        <p>
          These policies describe our Cancellation, Refund and Return Policies after the user makes a purchase of any subscription from https://mountstribe.com (the “Site”).
        </p>
        <h4 id="cancellation"><strong><b>Subscription Cancellation Policy</b></strong></h4>
        We grow plants on special order from the user. Hence by subscribing, user agrees to the following subscription cancellation policy:
        <ul>
          <li>Users can cancel their subscription within 24 hours of the payment, leading to full refund of the money. The user cannot cancel his/her subscription after 24 hours.</li>
          <li>In case, the user cannot receive the full subscription or any week's package of the subscription, no refunds shall be made for any part or the whole subscription.</li>
          <li>To cancel the subscription within 24 hours, user can request cancellation from the corressponding subscription from the Account page available at https://mountstribe.com/sign-in</li>
          <li>Our team will review the cancellation request and proceed to refund the full payment made for the subscription.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4 id="refund"><strong><b>Return Policy</b></strong></h4>
        <p>
          As of now, a subscription once received, cannot be returned. All we give to the users are plants (and not plant-derived products). Mountstribe tries to provide the best quality to its subscribers. However, being a customer-centric company, Mountstribe will look into the matter and postpone the subscription to the very next week after a review, in case any user raises a complain about any week's subscription.
        </p>

        <h4 id="refund"><strong><b>Refund Policy</b></strong></h4>
        <p>
          In case user cancels the subscription within 24 Hours of the payment made (as stated above), a full refund shall be made to the user in his/her bank account within 3 working days. Mountstribe will contact the subscriber after he/she requests cancellation. Also, as stated above, no refund shall be made after 24 Hours of the payment.
        </p>
